# Area of a regular polygon
## 6 kyu

Create a function for calculating the area of a regular polygon. The function takes one input parameter: a string containing the number of sides and the length of each side, such as `"4 sides of 5 cm each"`. It returns another string containing the area of the polygon with the right units, such as `"25.00 sq.cm"`. The anwer should be rounded to two digits after the decimal point. If the input string has a wrong format, the function returns "Invalid input".
