# Convert a linked list to a string

Although this Kata is not part of an official Series, you may also want to try out Parse a linked list from a string if you enjoyed this Kata.

### Preloaded

Preloaded for you is a class, struct or derived data type Node ( depending on the language ) used to construct linked lists in this Kata:
```
class Node {
  public $data, $next;
  public function __construct($data, $next = NULL) {
    $this->data = $data;
    $this->next = $next;
  }
}
```

### Prerequisites

This Kata assumes that you are already familiar with the idea of a linked list. If you do not know what that is, you may want to read [this article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list). Specifically, the linked lists this Kata is referring to are singly linked lists, where the value of a specific node is stored in its `data / $data / Data` property, the reference to the next node is stored in its `next / $next / Next / next_node` property and the terminator for a list is `null / NULL / None / nil / nullptr / null()`.

### Task

Create a function stringify which accepts an argument `list / $list` and returns a string representation of the list. The string representation of the list starts with the value of the current `Node`, specified by its` data / $data / Data` property, followed by a whitespace character, an arrow and another whitespace character (`" -> "`), followed by the rest of the list. The end of the string representation of a list must always end with `null / NULL / None / nil / nullptr / null()` ( all caps or all lowercase depending on the language you are undertaking this Kata in ). For example, given the following list:
```
new Node(1, new Node(2, new Node(3)))
```
... its string representation would be:
```
"1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL"
```
And given the following linked list:

... its string representation would be:
```
"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> NULL"
```
Note that `null / NULL / None / nil / nullptr / null()` itself is also considered a valid linked list. In that case, its string representation would simply be `"null" / "NULL" / "None" / "nil" / "nullptr" / @"NULL" / "null()"` ( again, depending on the language ).

For the simplicity of this Kata, you may assume that any Node in this Kata may only contain non-negative integer values. For example, you will not encounter a Node whose `data / $data / Data` property is `"Hello World"`.
