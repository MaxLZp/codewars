# T.T.T. #7: Profit or loss
## 7 Kyu

### Story

John runs a shop, bought some goods, and then sells them. He used a special accounting method, like this:
```
[[60,20],[60,-20]]
```
Each sub array records the commodity price and profit/loss to sell (percentage). Positive mean profit and negative means loss.

In the example above, John's first commodity sold at a price of $60, he made a profit of 20%; Second commodities are sold at a price of $60 too, but he lost 20%.

Please calculate, whether his account is profit or loss in the end?

### Rules

Write a function `profitLoss`, argument `records` is the list of sales.

return a number(positive or negative), round to two decimal places.

### Examples
```
In the example above:
profitLoss([[60,20],[60,-20]]) should return -5

Because the cost of the first commodity is 50, 
        the cost of the second commodity is 75,
        the total cost is: 50+75=125
        Selling price is:  60+60=120
So the end result is 120-125=-5. He made a loss of $5.

profitLoss([[100,20],[80,-20]]) should return -3.33
profitLoss([[60,100],[60,-50]]) should return -30
profitLoss([[60,0],[60,0]]) should return 0
```
