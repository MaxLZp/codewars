# Parsing Commandline Arguments
## 7 Kyu

We're given some typical *nix commands and want to parse them into their arguments. We'll ignore quoted arguments and other special characters, although if any of the characters `&`, `;`, `>`, `|` show up, those signify that a new command has started (so we can ignore any arguments after it).

### Examples

- `"ls -R /"` --> `["ls", "-R", "/"]`
- `"cat /tmp/data.txt` | `less" --> ["cat", "/tmp/data.txt"]`
- `"  ls -aF"` --> `["ls", "-aF"]`
    (note that we ignored the extra leading spaces on that last example)
