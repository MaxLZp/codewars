# Volume of the Largest Cube that Fits Inside a Given Cylinder
## 7 Kyu

Find the volume of the largest cube that will fit inside a cylinder of given height `h` and radius `r`.

Don't round your result. The result needs to be within 0.01 error margin of the expected result.

HINT: There are two cases to consider. Will it be the cylinder's height or the cylinder's radius that determines the maximum size of your cube? An if/else statement might be useful here.

### Two Examples
```
1. for height  3, radius 7 => should return  27.0
2. for height 11, radius 5 => should return 353.55
```
