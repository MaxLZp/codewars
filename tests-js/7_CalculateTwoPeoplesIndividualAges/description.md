# Calculate Two People's Individual Ages
## 7 kyu

Create a function that takes in the sum and age difference of two people, calculates their individual ages, and returns a pair of values (oldest age first) if those exist or `null/None` or `{-1, -1} in C` if:

- `sum < 0`
- `difference < 0`
- Either of the calculated ages come out to be negative
