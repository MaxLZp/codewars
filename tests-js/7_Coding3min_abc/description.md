Give you a number array `numbers` and a number `c`.

Find out a pair of numbers(we called them number a and number b) from the array `numbers`, let a*b=c, result format is an array `[a,b]`

The array `numbers` is a sorted array, value range: `-100...100`

The result will be the first pair of numbers, for example,f`indAB([1,2,3,4,5,6],6)` should return `[1,6]`, instead of `[2,3]`

Please see more example in testcases.
