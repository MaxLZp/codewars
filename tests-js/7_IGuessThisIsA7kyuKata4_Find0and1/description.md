# I guess this is a 7kyu kata #4: Find 0 and 1
## 7 Kyu

Give You an 2D array that only contains 0 and 1, please find out how many `1` are surrounded by `0` or `0` surrounded by `1`. "Surrounded" means that its four directions(up down left right) all are diffrent numbers.

Example:
```
[
[0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0],
[1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0],
[0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0]
]

There are three 1 surrounded by 0(the x in the array): 
[
[0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0],
[1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0],
[0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,x,0,1,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,0,x,0,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,x,0,0,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0]
]

There are two 0 surrounded by 1(the x in the array): 
[
[0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0],
[1,x,1,0,1,1,0,1,0],
[0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,1,x,1,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0],
[0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0]
]

So we need return a number 5 (three 1 + two 0)
```

### Task

Complete function `find01` that accepts a argument `arr`, return a number that is the count of `1` surrounded by `0` or `0` surrounded by `1`.
