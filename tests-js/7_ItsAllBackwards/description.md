# Its all backwards
## 7 Kyu

I give you this: `['This', 'Is', 'a' 'Example');`

You give me back this: `'examplE a iS thiS'`

So. I want what I give you back in reverse order, with only the last letter of each item capitalized. If the item is a single letter word and not capitalized when I give it to you, do not capitalize it.
